# NBA-Home-Court-Advantage

## Project Overview
In the NBA, teams play half of their regular season games at their home stadium and play the other half as the away team at other teamsâ€™ stadiums. Although the game of basketball remains the same no matter where the game is played, home-court advantage is believed to be a psychological and biased benefit that home teams experience due to factors like the familiarity/comfort with the arena and the encouragement from home fans. In this project, we will utilize data from the 2003-2004 to 2021-2022 NBA seasons to answer the question: **How important is home court advantage in the NBA?**

## Key Findings
- We estimate that home-court advantage provides an advantage of about 2.86 points overall, with this advantage jumping to about 4.40 points in the playoffs
- From our analysis, we can see that home teams generally score more points, record more assists and rebounds, and shoot higher field goal and three point percentages compared to away teams
- The main factors at play with home court advantage are arena familiarity and the momentum provided by a crowd, which we can observe from looking at the NBA Bubble, the 2020/2021 season, Lakers/Clippers matchups, Warriors/Cavs Finals matchups, and the home vs away win percentage for teams with varying levels of average attendance
- Based on our analysis, the momentum and encouragement provided by a crowd at sports games is the most significant factor in giving home teams an advantage, while arena familiarity is a smaller but still present factor
- Looking at our graph of home win percentage over time, there is a sharp downward trend starting in 2019 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but now that fan capacity is back to normal levels and we are moving past the pandemic, we expect the proportion of home wins and the home advantage in each of the individual statistics to go back up to pre-2019 levels
